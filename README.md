# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [pexp](https://github.com/iwiwsb/pexp), [olefile](https://github.com/iwiwsb/olefile), [wmf](https://github.com/iwiwsb/wmf) in no particular order. Probably will try to implement other [Windows Protocols](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols) in Rust
